        <div class="Article">
            <p>Created a survey in Survey123 Connect. The survey was 
                created using SAWC needs in mind, collecting location based info, type of request, date, attachment. Although some of the information we had to add as questions 
                are already collected in the metadata of the form, we needed to create fields for them to be stored, to keep the next step simplified in power automate.
                Publish the survey once its created. The following fields were created on the survey (note: these are not the exact field names)</p>
                <img src="assets/surveyxlsx.png" class="center" alt="the workbook containing the survey fields and esri field types">
            <ul>
                <li>Request Date: the date and time that the request is submitted</li>
                <li>Email: The user's email address, hidden (needed for automation workflow)</li>
                <li>Campus Zone Number: Integer from 1-11</li>
                <li>Priority Level: integer from 1-3</li>
                <li>Request Type: a string pick list with options for request type - default value set to 'general inspection'</li>
                <li>Request Location: geopoint of current/selected location</li>
                <li>point_x: calculate field hidden for longitude (needed for automation workflow)</li>
                <li>point_y: calculate field hidden for latitude (needed for automation workflow)</li>
                <li>Additional details: text field to provide further details of the issue</li>
                <li>Attachment: image field to attach an image of the issue</li>
            </ul>

        <button type = "button" class="ExpandingButton">Step 2: Automated Workflow for creating an Excel spreadsheet</button>
        <div class="Article">
            <p>We created an excel workbook that has three sheets, one for each level of priority. The fields in the sheets are the same as the survey fields, with the 
                addition of the following: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Assigned: Designed to be a Y/N field to indicate if the task has been assigned</li>
                <li>Employee: The full name of the employee assigned to the task to be updated by the manager</li>
                <li>Completed: Designed to be a Y/N field to indicate if the task has been completed</li>
                <li>Date Completed: the date in a standardized format that reflects the day the task was completed</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="assets/blankExcel.png" class="center" alt="Excel table">


            <p>First, we used Power Automate aka Flow which is a microsoft product in the Office 365 suite. The second software was called Make, which can be 
                viewed in 'Things we Tried'.
                <br>
                In Power Automate, we created a webhook that links to Survey123. Additionally, we created another webhook linking to a personal 
                Excel Onedrive account. The flow is triggered when a response is submitted to the linked survey. Next, an action is preformed to 
                convert the date/time from Epoch time to standard UTC time. Then a series of conditional statements are used to assess the priority 
                level of the survey, sorting each of the three priority levels into different tables in the excel spreadsheet. From there, we add a
                row into the excel table, populating it with the feature attributes from the survey. We assign the string 'N' to the field assigned and
                completed- to be later changed by the manager.</p>
            
        </div>


        <button type = "button" class="ExpandingButton">Step 3: Automated Workflow for generating reports</button>
        <div class="Article">
            <p>We created a PDF report that shows how many issues there have been in the time period. The PDF contains the title, the date converted into a mm/dd/yyyy format, and the number of incidents</p>
	<img src="assets/PDFReport.png" class="center" alt="PDF Report">
	<p>The PDF was generated using a Microsoft Power Automate Flow on a recurring basis. The Flow would be set to run every day/week/month. The information was taken from the excel workbook created in Step 2. Variables named date and counter were created to store the current date and 
	a variable used for iterations. The date was converted from UTC to a mm/dd/yyyy format so that it could be tested against each row in the excel sheet. This ensures that only the rows with the date from the current month/day/week
	are included in the report. An HTML document was used for formatting, which was then converted into a PDF. This PDF is sent in a link via email. 
		<br>
	Depending on what is wanted on the report, the Power Automate Flow could also record the number of a certain type of problem, how many problems were resolved, and other counts. The model that has been created has
	potential to generate more information.
