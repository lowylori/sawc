            <p>Once deployed on your account, you are able to start editing the components you would like to use. Firstly, open both surveys in Survey123 Connect to be able to
                edit them. While doing this, make sure to update the titles and names on the surveys to match the current project.
                 Once any edits are made to the survey to meet the requirements you are looking to meet, republish the survey.

                names of the dashboards to match the project. On the dashboard, ensure the data being presented makes sense in relation to the project goals
