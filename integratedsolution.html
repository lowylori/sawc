        <h2> Reporting System </h2>
        <p> The integrated reporting system uses Microsoft Power Automate to create a system of tools that would create an HTML document of the report, upload this to
		OneDrive, create a PDF out of that report, upload the PDF to OneDrive, and finally email a link with the PDF to anyone on the email list. This would run on a 
		timed basis, depending on when SAWC wants the reports created and sent out. 
		In practice, there would be three flows, one for each of the levels of priority, all that go out at different times. Below is a screenshot of the overall flow. 
        </p>
        <img class="solutionimage" src="assets/ReportingIntegratingSolution.png" alt="Integrated Reporting">    
	<ol>
		<li>Recurrance</li>
		<p>The recurrence happens whenever the report should be sent out. This flow is sent out once a month</p>
		<li>List Rows Present in Table</li>
		<p>The excel sheet previously created is access, and is later called in dynamic content</p>
		<li>Initialize Variable</li>
		<p>This creates a counter starting at 0. This is later used to count through how many incidents have occured in the month</p>
		<li>For Each</li>
		<p>For each is the equivalent of a for loop. The loop iterates through the excel table, and increments the counter with each row</p>
