            <p>For this solution, we integrated Survey123, Power Automate and Excel Onedrive to create a dynamic solution that
                enables us to accomplish a similar workflow that adapts to the existing technological knowledge and pen and paper
                method thats been communicated by the client. </p>

        <h2> Reporting System </h2>
        <p> The integrated reporting system uses Microsoft Power Automate to create a system of tools that would create an HTML document of the report, upload this to
		OneDrive, create a PDF out of that report, upload the PDF to OneDrive, and finally email a link with the PDF to anyone on the email list. This would run on a 
		timed basis, depending on when SAWC wants the reports created and sent out. 
		In practice, there would be three flows, one for each of the levels of priority, all that go out at different times. Below is a screenshot of the overall flow. 
        </p>

	<img class="solutionimage" src="assets/ReportingFlow2.png" alt="Integrated Reporting 2">          
	<ol>
		<li>Recurrance</li>
		<p>The recurrence happens whenever the report should be sent out. This flow is sent out once a month.</p>
		<li>List Rows Present in Table</li>
		<p>The excel sheet previously created is access, and is later called in dynamic content.</p>
		<li>Initialize Variable</li>
		<p>This creates a counter starting at 0. This is later used to count through how many incidents have occured in the month.</p>
		<li>Initialize Variable 2</li>
		<p>Creates the date variable, sets it to the current date with the format mm/dd/yyyy, or just mm if its daily</p>
		<li>For Each</li>
		<p>For each is the equivalent of a for loop. The loop iterates through the excel table.</p>
		<li>If the days/months in the rows are equivalent to the current date, the counter is incremented by 1.</li>
		<li>HTML to Text</li>
		<p>This action is where HTML is applied to create a report. Right now, there is only the title of the report and how many reports have occured. Input from SAWC would be needed to understand
		what else is required in the report.</p>
		<li>Create File</li>
		<p>The HTML file is uploaded to OneDrive. The date is used in the name so that the file does not overwrite another file.</p>
		<li>Convert File Using Path</li>
		<p>The HTML file is converted to a PDF, also with the date in the name.</p>
		<li>Create File 1</li>
		<p>The newly created PDF is uploaded to OneDrive.</p>
		<li>Sent an Email</li>
		<p>An email is sent with a link to the PDF.</p>
