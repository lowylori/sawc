            <h1> Integrated Solution</h1>
            <p>For this solution, we integrated Survey123, Power Automate and Excel Onedrive to create a dynamic solution that
                enables us to accomplish a similar solution to AGOL that adapts to the existing technological knowledge of the client.
                Once a survey is submitted, the Excel Workflow is initated, populating the excel document with the survey request. From there, 
                a manager can make modifications to the document, when they assign the task to a staff member. Excel sheets can be printed and 
                distributed to staff members as necessary. The manager can update tasks when they are 
                completed and set the completion date. Next, the excel spreadsheet connects to our scheduled report generating workflow, which uses the tasks 
                and their status to generate reports which are emailed and can be adapted to send out daily, weekly or monthly. </p>

            <h2>Assigning tasks</h2>
            <p>We used Power Automate to automate the process of taking a survey request and placing it into the excel onedrive workbook. As mentioned in the methodology, the workbook 
                had to be already set up in order to use this flow. See an image of the flow below.

        <h2> Reporting System </h2>
        <p> The integrated reporting system uses Microsoft Power Automate to create a system of tools that would create an HTML document of the report, upload this to
		OneDrive, create a PDF out of that report, upload the PDF to OneDrive, and finally email a link with the PDF to anyone on the email list. This would run on a 
		timed basis, depending on when SAWC wants the reports created and sent out. 
		In practice, there would be three flows, one for each of the levels of priority, all that go out at different times. Below is a screenshot of the overall flow.

	<ol>
		<li>Recurrance</li>
		<p>The recurrence happens whenever the report should be sent out. This flow is sent out once a month.</p>
		<li>List Rows Present in Table</li>
		<p>The excel sheet previously created is access, and is later called in dynamic content.</p>
		<li>Initialize Variable</li>
		<p>This creates a counter starting at 0. This is later used to count through how many incidents have occured in the month.</p>
		<li>Initialize Variable 2</li>
		<p>Creates the date variable, sets it to the current date with the format mm/dd/yyyy, or just mm if its daily</p>
		<li>For Each</li>
		<p>For each is the equivalent of a for loop. The loop iterates through the excel table.</p>
		<li>Condition</li>
		<p>If the days/months in the rows are equivalent to the current date, the counter is incremented by 1.</p>
		<li>HTML to Text</li>
		<p>This action is where HTML is applied to create a report. Right now, there is only the title of the report and how many reports have occured. Input from SAWC would be needed to understand
		what else is required in the report.</p>
		<li>Create File</li>
		<p>The HTML file is uploaded to OneDrive. The date is used in the name so that the file does not overwrite another file.</p>
		<li>Convert File Using Path</li>
		<p>The HTML file is converted to a PDF, also with the date in the name.</p>
		<li>Create File 1</li>
		<p>The newly created PDF is uploaded to OneDrive.</p>
		<li>Sent an Email</li>
		<p>An email is sent with a link to the PDF.</p>

	<h2>Overall Thoughts</h2>   
	<p>Microsoft Power Automate is useful for integrating different software into one solution. Team Purple Penguins wanted to come up with a solution that used more well known software like Excel so that 
	potentially more people could understand the workflow. The dynamic text is useful for Flows that will occur on a timed basis, and Flow also had a lot of online help. However, there were some flaws
	to this software. An issue that was common is that certain functions that would be easy to do in a programming language such as Python were slighly more complicated in Power Automate. Adding conditionals
	and interations took time to fully comprehend. There was also a licensing issue with Power Automate. The ideal way to create a report would be to populate a Word document. However, this was only available to 
	premium Microsoft users. A solution was found with HTML, but HTML is not a commonly known progamming language for the average person. If the report were to be change, someone with knowledge of HTML would need 
	to change it. Another issue that was found was the emailing of the actual report. Trying to attach a PDF to the email did not work. After some 
	<a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/power-apps-and-power-automate-in/sending-a-pdf-file-as-an-email-attachment-with-power-automate/m-p/3972229" target="_blank">online research</a>, it was discovered that 
	this was a common bug
	with the version 2 of the Send An Email action. The old version was unavailable. Overall, Microsoft Power Automate had many advantages with its pleasing isual display and ability to integrate ESRI software with 
	Microsoft software. There are many challenges to consider before implementing a FLow as a reporting system.
