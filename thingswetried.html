    <button type = "button" class="ExpandingButton">Building a solution from scratch</button>
	    <div class="Article">
	        <p>For the first part of the web time, our group investigated different pieces of building a solution from scratch. The idea was to build separate components of the solution and 
                combine them together. The reason we didn’t end up doing this on ArcGIS Online was because we found the ArcGIS Solutions to be much better designed in terms of compatibility and layout/design. 
                This was a good learning experience though to see how to design all these pieces separately, if we needed to redesign parts of a pre-made solution.
                Pieces of our build own solution look like: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><a href=" https://arcg.is/1vfvbO0" target="_blank"> A survey to collect data on incidents. </a></li>
                    <li><a href=" https://fieldmaps.arcgis.app/?itemID=0064db3d196b476ba7e4f304c2fcda42&referenceContext=open&portalURL=https%3A%2F%2FFleming.maps.arcgis.com" target="_blank"> A field map for in field collection. </a></li>

        <button type = "button" class="ExpandingButton">Citizen Problem Reporter Solution</button>
	    <div class="Article">
	        <p>Before using the Parks and Grounds Management solution, the citizen problem reporter solution was looked into. 
                This solution has the pro of a nice dashboard and was fairly easy to use, however, the parks and grounds solution was designed overall better 
                for what we are looking to solve. The citizen dashboard seemed to be designed for a city or municipality, but the parks and grounds one is more targeted, 
                which was a bonus of it. Also, the parks and grounds surveys were already designed nicely for what we were looking to solve and how we could use the 
                pre-existing categories in our solution. A con of the citizen solution was also that it wasn’t as user friendly from a manager side. 
                The public side was easier to use but I found some confusion in how to find the right layer to assign tasks to staff. 
                Our solution we hoped to design was meant to be straightforward and user friendly and this con did play a role in why it was not chosen for this. 
                Overall, this solution is nice but not for the problem we were aiming to address.

	        <p>Log into ArcGIS Solutions, through the ArcGIS Online portal. Search for the relevant solution you are looking for; in this case it was “Parks and Grounds Management”. 
                Click the “Deploy now” button to deploy this solution so your account. </p>
