    <h1>Southern African Wildlife College: Security, Heath and Safety, Environment and Quality Solution</h1>
    
    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <h3>Ideal</h3>
    <p>A centralized platform where anybody can report a problem on campus and then it be assigned to a specific 
        person/department depending on the zone and tracked using a dashboard. Generate automated reports to 
        summarize problems reported and derive trends.</p>
    <h3>Reality</h3>
    <p>Right now they collect their data and track it all separately, and they do much of it by paper. There is 
        no efficient way to report results, there are many different places they have to look for data. There is 
        no way to track productivity and how efficiently tasks are getting done. </p>
    <h3>Consequences</h3>
    <p>They will not have a centralized way to track issues and progress on their issues and things may fall through 
        the cracks. This causes a certain level of risk for the residents on campus in terms of security, heath and 
        safety, environment and quality.</p>
    <h3>Proposal</h3>
    <p>Create a centralized platform that allows the college to assign and track progress for SHEQ (security, health 
        and safety, environment, and quality) tasks categorized by pre-designated zones of their campus and level of 
        priority. Solution should be easy to use and require minimal or no maintenance.</p>
    <h3>Technology Used</h3>
    <p>ArcGIS online Ecosystem (ArcGIS Workforce, FieldMaps, Survey123, ArcGIS Dashboards), Power Automate, Excel onedrive</p>
